what have I done this week? I'm not too sure, it's running into the stuff I did last week. 

I started a new package to work on integrating with Helena's sprite tree. It's called npsprite. I don't remember which commit it was.

I also worked on collisionEvents. It's not very well done right now, the original plan was to work with static methods

Fixed a very small bug in the LevelObjectsFactory and in Helena's tester. To be fair, I think I might have created the bug in the maingame in the first place, before I created the npsprite package
