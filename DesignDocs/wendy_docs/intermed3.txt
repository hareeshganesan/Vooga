Rewrote to use property objects instead of interfaces, merged with main game. 

Marked the old sprite package deprecated

Massive merging, which was done with help from hareesh (to figure out inputs and physics) and helena (to figure out how the sprite tree integrate with physics engine)

It's not very clean code at all, compounded by the fact that I had to take into account Helena's changes with the movement of sprites up to the point of animation, and Donghe's physics engine (which relied on hard-coded reflection...and he wasn't around by that point to help).

Run PropertiesTest and NPSTest inside npsprites, the maingame hasn't implemented properties/collisions fully yet. There are still issues with the connections that have to be dealt with before implementing additional features.
