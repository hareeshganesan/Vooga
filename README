-------------- Time Spent --------------------

Group Meetings:
	Thursday, March 29, 2012	8:00 - 11:00 PM
	Sunday, April 1, 2012		2:00 PM - 11:59 PM
	Monday, April 2, 2012		12:00 AM - 5:00 AM
	
	** UTAs attended 4/1 meeting from about 3 - 7 PM.	

Individual Time (outside meetings):
	Approximately 3 hours spent per person
	
Total Group Time Spent = almost 150 hours 	

This is pretty commensurate with how much time we expected to spend overall.
We all knew that this would be a large and complex design project where we
had to start from scratch and do a lot of thinking about design and organization,
as well as coding itself. We had initially hoped that our Sunday-Monday meeting
would end sooner than it did but did recognize the possible need for a very late
or all-night working meeting.	


--------------- Resources Used -----------------

Java API
Oracle tutorials
Golden T API
JDOM tutorials
Google search...


--------------- Instructions/Notes -------------

For part 2 (3/26-4/2), please configure build path to include:
-golden_0_2_3.jar (golden t framework)
-jdom-1.1.2.jar   (jdom for xml parsing)
-jaxen.jar        (xpath for jdom)

There are three different main methods. Run the Main inside src/LevelEditor to build a xml file with only one fighter, and the MainGame inside src/ to load a game.

If you want to see how the game is supposed to run a saved file with two fightersprites, 
open "sample.xml" inside the "resources" folder.
