-------------- Time Spent Version 2-------------

Group Meetings:
	Wednesday, April 4, 2012	7:30 PM - 11:30 PM
	Thursday, April 5, 2012		7:30 PM - 11:59 PM
	Friday, April 6, 2012		12:00 AM - 1:30 AM
	
	** UTA attended 4/5 meeting from about ~ 8 - 8:30 PM.	

Individual Time (outside meetings):
	Approximately 3 hours spent per person

Total Group Time Spent = ~ 91 hrs

This is about how long we expected, considering none of us knew 
the code was due on Friday at 8AM until Wednesday night, and several 
of us haven't met with the UTAs to talk over version 1 as of writing this README.

		
-------------- Time Spent Version 1-------------

Group Meetings:
	Thursday, March 29, 2012	8:00 - 11:00 PM
	Sunday, April 1, 2012		2:00 PM - 11:59 PM
	Monday, April 2, 2012		12:00 AM - 5:00 AM
	
	** UTAs attended 4/1 meeting from about 3 - 7 PM.	

Individual Time (outside meetings):
	Approximately 3 hours spent per person
	
Total Group Time Spent = almost 150 hours 	

This is pretty commensurate with how much time we expected to spend overall.
We all knew that this would be a large and complex design project where we
had to start from scratch and do a lot of thinking about design and organization,
as well as coding itself. We had initially hoped that our Sunday-Monday meeting
would end sooner than it did but did recognize the possible need for a very late
or all-night working meeting.

Run the Main in LevelEditor to create a xml file saving level details (default saves to src/resources/ folder).

Run MainGame, load a file using file chooser, and play it. 

Please do NOT write a xml file with more or less than 2 fighter sprites, we can't account for that yet.
