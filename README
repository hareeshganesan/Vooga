For part 2 (3/26-4/2), please configure build path to include:
-golden_0_2_3.jar (golden t framework)
-jdom-1.1.2.jar   (jdom for xml parsing)
-jaxen.jar        (xpath for jdom)

there are three different main methods, and they don't connect right now. 
CharacterEditor.zip has one, that is supposed to save player sprites. 
LevelEditor has one, which saves "block"s (platform sprites). 

The default package has one inside the "MainGame". If you want to see how the game is supposed to run a saved file, open "sample.xml" inside the "resources" folder.
